Broadly speaking, anything telling users where they are, where to go and how to get there can be called navigation. When using navigation or customizing navigational structures, please pay attention to following common pitfalls:

- Provide visual and contextual cues as many as possible, to prevent users from getting lost
- Maintain consistency between form and behavior, or reduce the number of items in navigation, to decrease user's learning cost
- Minimize page transitions (i.e. reduce the number of page transitions required by a task from several to just once or twice), to ensure that user travels only a short distance from any page to another
