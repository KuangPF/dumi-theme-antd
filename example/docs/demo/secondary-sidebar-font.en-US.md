The font system is one of the most foundational parts of any interface design.

Text is a major channel for users to understand application content and complete their work, and a well designed font system will greatly enhance the user's reading experience and work efficiency. The Ant Design typography system is based on the design principle of "dynamic order" combined with the law of natural logarithm and temperament. We strongly recommend it since it has been verified by a large number of Ant products. While defining the font system for a visual system, we propose to start from the following five aspects:

1. Font Family
2. Base Font Size
3. Font Scale & Line Height
4. Font Weight
5. Font Color
