Spatial layout is the starting point of systematic visual design. The difference from traditional graphic design is that the layout space of UI interface should be based on the dynamic and systematic perspective. We were inspired by the architectural ethic of the architect Le Corbusier and explored the dynamic spatial order in UI design and formed the interface layout of Ant Design based on the principle of 'beauty of order', making it possible for designers to create spatial layout that comes with rational beauty.

While defining the layout system in a visual system, we propose to start from the following 5 aspects:ï¼š

1. Unified Canvas Dimension
2. Adaptation
3. Grid Unit
4. Raster
5. Common Scales
