Ant Design interprets the color system into two levels: a system-level color system and a product-level color system.

The system-level color system mainly defines the basic color palette, neutral color palette and data visualization color palette in the design of Ant Financial. The product-level color system is in the specific design process, based on the color of the system to further define the tone of the product in accordance with the requirements and function of the color.
