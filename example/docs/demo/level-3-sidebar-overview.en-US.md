The use of design patterns in enterprise-level businesses can significantly increase the certainty of the R&D team, save unnecessary design and maintain system consistency, allowing designers to focus on creativity where it is most needed.

Design patterns adhere to Ant Design design values and provide a general solution to recurring design issues in enterprise products. The designer can directly use the design pattern to complete the interface design, or the design pattern can be used as a starting point to derive a more business-specific solution to meet the individual design needs.
