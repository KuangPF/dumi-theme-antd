## development status

The first version of `dumi-theme-antd` has been developed, but it is not yet fully adapted to some features of the Antd Design 5.0 official website. This is a continuous process. If you have any questions, please contact [issues](https://github .com/KuangPF/dumi-theme-antd/issues) form feedback.

## contribute

### Development Process

It is recommended to use `pnpm` as a package management tool.

After you clone the dumi-theme-antd code and use:
<InstallDependencies defaultActiveKey='pnpm' pnpm='$ pnpm install' npm='$ npm install' yarn='$ yarn'></InstallDependencies>

After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the development mode. <InstallDependencies defaultActiveKey='pnpm' pnpm='$ pnpm run docs' npm='$ npm run docs' yarn='$ yarn docs'></InstallDependencies>

Modify `/src` to debug the files in the directory.
